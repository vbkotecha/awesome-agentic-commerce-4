## What is Agentic Commerce?

Agentic commerce is the emerging paradigm where AI agents act on behalf of users to discover products, compare options, and complete purchases. Instead of humans clicking "buy" buttons on websites, AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot can browse catalogs, compare prices, and execute transactions autonomously.

**The Challenge:** Traditional e-commerce assumes a human is directly interacting with a website. When an AI agent acts on behalf of a user, new questions arise:
- How does a merchant know the agent is authorized to buy?
- How can agents from different platforms communicate?
- How do you prove the user actually wanted this purchase?

**The Solution:** These five protocols work together to create a secure, interoperable foundation for agent-led commerce.

<br>

## UCP - Universal Commerce Protocol

> End-to-end commerce standard for AI agent transactions

**Maintainers:** Google, Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart

### What is UCP?

UCP is "the common language for platforms, agents, and businesses." It defines building blocks for the entire commerce journey—from product discovery to checkout to order tracking—through a single, standardized interface.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Checkout** - Unified checkout sessions supporting complex cart logic, dynamic pricing, and tax calculations
- **Identity Linking** - OAuth 2.0-based secure connections between agents and user accounts (loyalty programs, saved addresses)
- **Order Management** - Real-time webhooks for shipment tracking, returns, and post-purchase updates

**Why it matters:** Without UCP, every agent platform would need custom integrations with every merchant (N×N problem). UCP collapses this into a single standard that any agent can use with any UCP-enabled merchant.

## ACP - Agentic Commerce Protocol

> Open standard for programmatic commerce between AI agents and businesses

**Maintainers:** OpenAI, Stripe

### What is ACP?

ACP enables AI agents to complete purchases on behalf of users directly within chat interfaces—like buying products without leaving a ChatGPT conversation. It powers features like "Instant Checkout" where users can discover and purchase items seamlessly.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Shared Payment Token (SPT)** - A secure, one-time-use token that lets agents initiate payments without ever seeing the user's card number. The token is scoped to a specific merchant and cart total.
- **Agentic Checkout** - A RESTful API (or MCP server) that merchants implement with four endpoints: create, update, complete, and cancel checkout
- **Delegated Payment** - The flow where Stripe (or another PSP) issues an SPT, and the agent passes it to the merchant to complete the transaction

**Why it matters:** ACP separates payment credentials from the agent entirely. The user pays through Stripe's secure interface, receives an SPT, and the agent never touches sensitive payment data—solving the PCI compliance challenge for AI commerce.

## AP2 - Agent Payments Protocol

> Secure payment authorization for agent-led transactions using cryptographic mandates

**Maintainers:** FIDO Alliance (donated by Google, April 2026) + 60 partners
**Latest version:** v0.2 (introduces "Human Not Present" autonomous payments)

### What is AP2?

AP2 solves a fundamental problem: **How do you prove a user actually authorized an agent to make a purchase?** Today's payment systems assume a human is clicking "buy." When an autonomous agent makes a purchase—especially when the user isn't present—there's no proof of intent.

AP2 introduces **Mandates**: tamper-proof, cryptographically-signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable evidence of user authorization.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Intent Mandate** - Pre-authorization for future purchases with constraints. Example: "Buy concert tickets under $100 when they go on sale." The agent can act autonomously within these bounds.
- **Cart Mandate** - Explicit approval for a specific cart. The user reviews the exact items and price, then signs. This is non-repudiable proof of intent.
- **Payment Mandate** - Signals to payment networks that an agent is involved, enabling appropriate risk assessment and dispute resolution.

**Why it matters:** When disputes arise ("I didn't authorize this!"), AP2 mandates provide cryptographic proof of exactly what the user approved. This protects merchants, payment providers, and users in the new world of autonomous agent purchases.

## MPP - Machine Payments Protocol

> Open standard for autonomous agent micropayments

**Co-Authors:** Stripe, Tempo

### What is MPP?

MPP is an open standard for autonomous agent micropayments. It introduces a **sessions primitive** that allows AI agents to initiate, manage, and settle small-value transactions without human intervention at each step.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sessions** - A primitive that bundles multiple micropayments into a single authorized context, reducing friction for high-frequency agent transactions
- **Micropayments** - Designed for small-value, high-volume payments typical of agent-to-agent and agent-to-service interactions
- **Multi-Rail Support** - Supports card networks, digital wallets, and Lightning Network for flexible settlement

**Why it matters:** As AI agents consume paid APIs, purchase digital goods, and transact with other agents autonomously, traditional checkout flows break down. MPP provides a purpose-built payment layer for machine-to-machine commerce at scale.

## AMP - Agentic Mobile Protocol

> Open-source mobile-first agentic payment framework for digital wallets, super apps, and wearables

**Maintainers:** Ant International (Alipay+ ecosystem)
**Launched:** April 2026

### What is AMP?

AMP is the first agentic payment protocol designed natively for mobile interfaces — smartphones, smartwatches, AR glasses, and in-car systems — rather than card-based desktop checkout. It establishes a universal, auditable standard for AI agents to transact across digital wallets and super apps.

**Key Concepts:**
- **KYA (Know Your Agent) Framework** - Establishes an agent's digital identity and certifies its authorized capabilities, parallel to KYC for humans
- **Agent Trust Rating** - Dynamic risk-management score that determines an agent's trustworthiness and controls its level of autonomy
- **Money-back Guarantee** - Every agent-initiated transaction is backed by a refund mechanism for payment partners in cases of account takeover
- **Cross-device Compatibility** - Designed for non-card form factors absent from traditional payment rails

**Why it matters:** The Alipay+ network reaches 1.8B user accounts and 150M merchants globally — primarily across APAC. AMP gives this footprint an agentic-commerce layer and complements card-based protocols (Visa TAP, Mastercard Agent Pay) for emerging markets where mobile wallets dominate.

## A2A - Agent2Agent Protocol

> Open standard for AI agent interoperability and communication

**Maintainers:** Google (Linux Foundation)

### What is A2A?

A2A enables AI agents built on different frameworks, by different companies, running on separate servers to discover each other's capabilities and collaborate on tasks—**as agents, not just as tools.**

Think of it as the "common language" that lets a travel planning agent talk to a flight booking agent, a hotel agent, and a car rental agent to coordinate a complete trip.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Agent Card** - A JSON document that agents publish describing who they are, what they can do, and how to communicate with them. It's like a business card for AI agents.
- **Tasks** - The fundamental unit of work. Tasks have a lifecycle (submitted → working → completed/failed) and can be long-running with progress updates.
- **Messages & Parts** - Agents communicate through messages containing different content types: text, files, or structured data.
- **Update Mechanisms** - Three ways to get task updates: polling (simple), streaming (real-time), or push notifications (webhooks for async work).

**A2A vs MCP:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects agents to **tools and data**. A2A connects **agents to other agents**. They're complementary—an agent might use MCP to access a database and A2A to delegate work to a specialized agent.

## How They Relate

```
User → AI Agent → A2A (agent discovery & coordination)
                → UCP/ACP (commerce actions)
                → AP2 (payment authorization)
                → MPP (agent micropayments)
                → Payment Rails (Stripe, Visa TAP, Mastercard, PayPal, x402, L402)
                → Merchants & Payment Networks
```

| Protocol | Layer | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **A2A** | Communication | Agents discover and talk to each other |
| **UCP** | Commerce | End-to-end commerce (Google ecosystem) |
| **ACP** | Commerce | Agent checkout (OpenAI/Stripe ecosystem) |
| **AP2** | Payments | Secure payment authorization with mandates |
| **MPP** | Payments | Autonomous agent micropayments via sessions |
| **AMP** | Payments | Mobile-first agentic payments via digital wallets (Alipay+) |
| **x402/L402** | Crypto Rails | Stablecoin and Lightning Network payments for agents |
| **Visa TAP / Mastercard Agent Pay / PayPal Agent Ready** | Fiat Rails | Card network and wallet infrastructure for agent transactions |

### Example: Planning a Trip

1. **A2A** - Your personal agent discovers a flight agent, hotel agent, and car rental agent
2. **A2A** - Agents collaborate to find options within your $700 budget
3. **AP2** - You create an Intent Mandate: "Book travel under $700 total"
4. **UCP/ACP** - Each agent executes checkout with their respective merchants
5. **AP2** - Cart Mandates are signed for each booking, providing proof of your approval
6. **Result** - Three coordinated bookings, all cryptographically tied to your authorization

### UCP vs ACP

Both enable commerce, but target different ecosystems:
- **UCP** - Google AI surfaces (Search AI Mode, Gemini), supports identity linking, uses AP2 for payments
- **ACP** - OpenAI/ChatGPT ecosystem, uses Shared Payment Tokens via Stripe

Merchants wanting maximum reach may implement both.
